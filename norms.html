    <h2>Shepherds</h2>
    <p>You may see some Shepherds while you are visiting the city. Do not worry. The Shepherds are only there for your protection. If don't bother them, they will not bother you. Avoid speaking to them or staring at them for too long.
    </p>
    <h2>The Herald</h2>
    <p>The Herald is revered as the saviour of our city. Citizens of the city may make genstures or prayers in his name. Be respectful of the religion of the people of the Hold. You don't have to believe it, but some citizens would take great offense to any sort of balsphemy against the Herald.
